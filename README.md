<h1 align="center">Wanyamapori Sanctuary</h1>

[For your refrence](https://lenn84.github.io/Wild-life-website/)

The main purpose of Wanyamapori sanctuary website is to make the public aware of the dangers the wildlife is experiencing. In addition is to promote the efforts of the sanctuary in protecting and taking care of the endangered wild animals as by seen with programs set in place to educate the public and various activities.

Over time wildlife has been in great danger due to human ignorance and thirst for development. Due to technological advancement through time it is fair to say the best way to reach the general public is through the internet.  The main aim is to show the general public over the vast internet that wildlife is endangered and there are organizations in place to conserve the wildlife.

The endpoint is to bring about awareness through use of mass media of the beauty and dangers wildlife goes through due to ignorance by the human race.

        2. The website has a few videos and were sourced from www.pexels.com. All videos are responsive.
