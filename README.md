<h1 align="center">Wanyamapori Sanctuary</h1>

[For your reference](https://lenn84.github.io/Wild-life-website/)

The main purpose of Wanyamapori sanctuary website is to make the public aware of the dangers the wildlife is experiencing. In addition is to promote the efforts of the sanctuary in protecting and taking care of the endangered wild animals as by seen with programs set in place to educate the public and various activities.

Over time wildlife has been in great danger due to human ignorance and thirst for development. Due to technological advancement through time it is fair to say the best way to reach the general public is through the internet.  The main aim is to show the general public over the vast internet that wildlife is endangered and there are organizations in place to conserve the wildlife.

The endpoint is to bring about awareness through use of mass media of the beauty and dangers wildlife goes through due to ignorance by the human race.

   - #### Color Scheme

        1. There are three main colours used i.e.; white for the background, black and green used in an array of texts.The use of green was an inspiration from the Kenya Wildlife Service and Nature its self with the website pertaining wildlife.
        2. All links were illustrated with the blue colour for easy differentiation from ordinary texts.
        3. For the footer a simple black was used with texts illustrated in white for visibility.
        4. A shade of grey was used for hover action on select links. I sought it not to have the hover action in all links.
        5. A shade of yellow colour was used in “know the place” buttons to give out a vibrant feel to the projects page.

    - #### Typography

        1. The Monserrat font is the main font used throughout the website with Sans-Serif set as the alternative font if for any reason the Monserrat font does not render correctly. Monserrat is widely used in multiple websites because of its geometric and elegant simplicity.

    - #### Images,Videos and other Forms of Media

        1. In this website there is an extensive use of images and videos to give out nature feel within the websiteRegarding images, only the hero image in the home page has text on it and the image is a background image. This sets the image aside from the other images that are in the foreground of every page.I ensured all the images are in .PNG format and were sourced from [Unsplash](www.unsplash.com).And all the images present in all pages are responsive. 
        2. The website has a few videos and were sourced from [Pexels](www.pexels.com). All videos are responsive.
        3. For the maps displayed in the website, they were embedded in iframe tag and are all responsive.

 - #### First Time Visitor Goals

      1. I want the ability to be quickly acquitted with what the website is about at sight.
      
            - On opening of the website, the user is able to access the distinct navigation bar that enables the swift movement to all other pages.

          - Its best to say the section contains areas that haven’t been presented well enough in the website.

     3. I want to experience the wild in the comfort of where I am.

          - This is quite easy due to the implementation of the gallery page that is navigated though the navigation bar.
          - In the gallery page there are an array of images depicting the wild.
          - The page has a large number of pictures that can keep the user interested.

          - Just in case the user is missing some details and wants any form of assistance or additional information, there is an option to call “Call to find out more”

      5. I want to add a mock-up of the Sign-In page and the Sign-Up page utility to make the website look more stellar.

          - The user can press on the Sign In / Sign Up link in the navigation bar to access the Sign In page.
          - The user would be welcomed with a sign in page with a lion at the background. The user will also be prompted to fill the section provided with accurate details such as email and password.
          - The email input should have the correct format of @.

      6. I want to have other social medial platforms in the footer to enable easy sharing of ideas between multiple users and the world at large.

          - On the far right we have three main social media icons that on a click move the respective sign in page of the website.
          - In addition, I added the map icon that is a direct link to Google maps.


## Further Testing.

- The website was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft edge and safari browser.

- The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPad, iPad Pro & iPhone X.

- A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.

- Some Friends and Family were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs or experience issues.

## Known Bugs.

- The images in the gallery page take a significant amount of time to load. Regardless all images load but after having taken a while.

- On closer inspection the image loading issue is only present in the chrome browser.

- In the gallery page one will notice that the last images at the bottom of the pagea are slightly croped out in larger screen devices.This is because I couldnt make the images end in the same line hence use of an empty div to make the illusion that all iamges end in the same line. 


## Development Obstacles.

- Wireframes.

     1. The wireframe platform was not the best place to style the website. Due to its limited time offer of the free trial I was left with a rough sketch of the website.

     2. I had to work with what I had even if it wasn’t a good experience but the website was up to expectations.

- Code Refactoring.

     1. Organization of the codes wants in mind since it was my first major project as an introduction to web development.

     2. Experience is built through repeated exercises and indeed I have been able to collect a few skills to build up my experience.

- Commit Messages.

     1. This was the most challenging part since the start of the website.

     2. It was challenging to write commit massages hence became hard to go back to initial commits for correction purposes. 

     3. Also, this can be put in same context as lacking the experience since it was my first project.

     4. As of now the commit messages are more professional and easier to follow up on code additions and omissions.

## Deployment
