[For your refrence](https://lenn84.github.io/Wild-life-website/)

The main purpose of Wanyamapori sanctuary website is to make the public aware of the dangers the wildlife is experiencing. In addition is to promote the efforts of the sanctuary in protecting and taking care of the endangered wild animals as by seen with programs set in place to educate the public and various activities.

Over time wildlife has been in great danger due to human ignorance and thirst for development. Due to technological advancement through time it is fair to say the best way to reach the general public is through the internet.  The main aim is to show the general public over the vast internet that wildlife is endangered and there are organizations in place to conserve the wildlife.

The endpoint is to bring about awareness through use of mass media of the beauty and dangers wildlife goes through due to ignorance by the human race.

        1. There are three main colours used i.e.; white for the background, black and green used in an array of texts.The use of green was an inspiration from the Kenya Wildlife Service and Nature its self with the website pertaining wildlife.
        2. All links were illustrated with the blue colour for easy differentiation from ordinary texts.
        3. For the footer a simple black was used with texts illustrated in white for visibility.
        4. A shade of grey was used for hover action on select links. I sought it not to have the hover action in all links.
        5. A shade of yellow colour was used in “know the place” buttons to give out a vibrant feel to the projects page.

    - #### Typography

        1. The Monserrat font is the main font used throughout the website with Sans-Serif set as the alternative font if for any reason the Monserrat font does not render correctly. Monserrat is widely used in multiple websites because of its geometric and elegant simplicity.

    - #### Images,Videos and other Forms of Media

        1. In this website there is an extensive use of images and videos to give out nature feel within the websiteRegarding images, only the hero image in the home page has text on it and the image is a background image. This sets the image aside from the other images that are in the foreground of every page.I ensured all the images are in .PNG format and were sourced from www.unsplash.com.And all the images present in all pages are responsive. 
        2. The website has a few videos and were sourced from www.pexels.com. All videos are responsive.
